🚢 Titanic Data Visualization Project
This project explores the Titanic dataset through a wide range of data visualization techniques using Python. It covers univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and advanced visual analysis, providing a detailed view of survival patterns, passenger demographics, and class distributions.

📁 Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a classic in the field of data science, containing information on passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including:

Survival status, Passenger class, Sex, Age, Fare paid, And more...

📌 You can find the dataset on Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (PyCharm IDE)

# matplotlib.pyplot – For base-level plotting and customization.

🐧 seaborn – For high-level, attractive statistical visualizations.

# Visualizations Performed
1️⃣ Univariate Analysis
Histogram – Age distribution

Countplot – Passenger class

Pie Chart – Survival rate

2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis
Boxplot – Age distribution across classes

Barplot – Survival rate by class

Scatterplot – Fare vs. Age

3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis
Heatmap – Correlation matrix (after handling missing values)

Pairplots – Multiple variable relationships

4️⃣ Advanced Visualizations
Violin Plot – Age distribution by survival status

Swarmplot – Survival based on class and gender

FacetGrid – Age and class breakdown with survival overlay

5️⃣ Categorical & Time-Based Insights
Countplot – Gender vs survival

Lineplot – Simulated trend analysis with age

6️⃣ Customization & Styling
Applied themes, annotations, and visual polish to make graphs more presentable and insightful.
