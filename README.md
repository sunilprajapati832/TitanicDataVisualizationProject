# Titanic Data Visualization Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset through a wide range of data visualization techniques using Python.
It covers:
1. **Univariate Analysis** — Distribution of individual variables  
2. **Bivariate Analysis** — Relationships between two variables  
3. **Multivariate Analysis** — Correlation between multiple variables  
4. **Advanced Visualizations** — Violin plots, swarm plots, and FacetGrids  
5. **Categorical & Time-Based Analysis** — Class-wise and gender-based insights

## Objective
The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to discover key insights about **passenger survival patterns**, demographic trends and relationships between various features such as age, class, fare and gender.  

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is a classic in the field of data science, containing information on passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including:

Survival status, Passenger class, Sex, Age and Fare paid etc.

📌 You can find the dataset on Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (PyCharm IDE)

# matplotlib.pyplot – For base-level plotting and customization.

🐧 seaborn – For high-level, attractive statistical visualizations.

# Visualizations Performed

1️⃣ Univariate Analysis
Histogram – Age distribution

Countplot – Passenger class

Pie Chart – Survival rate

2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis
Boxplot – Age distribution across classes

Barplot – Survival rate by class

Scatterplot – Fare vs. Age

3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis
Heatmap – Correlation matrix (after handling missing values)

Pairplots – Multiple variable relationships

4️⃣ Advanced Visualizations
Violin Plot – Age distribution by survival status

Swarmplot – Survival based on class and gender

FacetGrid – Age and class breakdown with survival overlay

5️⃣ Categorical & Time-Based Insights
Countplot – Gender vs survival

Lineplot – Simulated trend analysis with age

6️⃣ Customization & Styling
Applied themes, annotations, and visual polish to make graphs more presentable and insightful.
